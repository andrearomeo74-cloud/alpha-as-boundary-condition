# Claims and Non-Claims

This file defines the explicit claims made by this repository, the claims it does not make, and the criteria for admissibility.

The purpose is not persuasion, but boundary clarity.

## Core claim

This repository makes the following core claim:

The fine structure constant α can be coherently interpreted as a boundary condition that stabilizes admissible electromagnetic coupling across scales.

This is a structural interpretation, not a mechanistic one.

## What this repository claims

This repository claims that:

• α summarizes a stable coupling regime rather than an adjustable control parameter  
• Treating α as a boundary condition is compatible with QED, RG, and standard physics  
• Narratives that imply easy manipulation of α usually omit proportional cost accounting  
• Congruity provides a principled way to test whether such narratives are admissible  
• Boundary conditions restrict what variations are allowed without global incoherence  

No claim is made that this interpretation replaces existing theory.

## What this repository does not claim

This repository explicitly does NOT claim that:

• α can be tuned, engineered, or vibrated into a new value  
• α manipulation enables warp, teleportation, propulsion, or spacetime shortcuts  
• New forces, particles, dimensions, or hidden variables exist  
• Existing physical laws are wrong or incomplete  
• Experimental procedures follow from this work  
• Predictions or timelines can be derived from this framing  

Any interpretation implying direct control or exploitation of α lies outside the scope of this repository.

## Admissible extensions

The following would be considered admissible downstream extensions:

• Formal mathematical analysis of α as a boundary constraint  
• RG-based interpretations consistent with cost scaling  
• Information-theoretic treatments respecting physical overhead  
• Thought experiments that explicitly account for energy, information, and structure  

Such work must remain explicit about its assumptions and limits.

## What would count as evidence

Because this repository is conceptual, evidence is defined structurally, not experimentally.

Admissible evidence would include:

• Demonstrations that boundary-condition framing reduces contradictions  
• Clarification of why α remains stable across regimes  
• Proofs that certain narratives violate proportionality constraints  
• Improved consistency between scale transitions  

Claims of engineering feasibility do not count as evidence here.

## Failure conditions

This repository would fail if:

• It implied causal mechanisms without cost accounting  
• It suggested control without proportional overhead  
• It collapsed into metaphor without constraint  
• It drifted into speculative engineering  

Such drift would render the repository non-admissible by its own standards.
