# Alpha as Boundary Condition

This repository explores the fine structure constant, α, as a boundary condition of admissible coupling.

It does not claim that α can be tuned, engineered, or “vibrated” into a different value.

It does not introduce new forces, hidden variables, or alternative ontology.

It is a Congruity based framing, focused on admissibility, constraints, and coherence across regimes.

## Core framing

α is treated as a compact summary of how electromagnetic interaction remains stable and computable across scales.

In Congruity terms, α is approached as a boundary condition that keeps coupling coherent, rather than a knob to be turned.

If a proposed narrative implies “easy control” of α without paying proportional costs in Energy, Information, and Structure, it is flagged as non admissible.

## What this repository is

Conceptual, regime aware, cross domain

Downstream of the canonical law, not part of it

Focused on structural coherence, not on predictions

A place to separate semantic metaphors from admissible physics

## What this repository is not

Not a mechanism for warp, teleport, propulsion, or gravity control

Not an experimental protocol

Not a model to modify physical constants

Not a substitute for QED, QFT, RG, or standard cosmology

## Why α is a “boundary condition” here

Because many deep constants can be interpreted as “stability locks” that prevent runaway behavior.

In a Congruity lens, α can be viewed as a constraint that keeps

Energy costs bounded

Information requirements finite

Structural overhead stable

Functional value non divergent

If α were freely adjustable, the system would need an admissible accounting of the required Energy, Information, and Structure to do so, otherwise it becomes a narrative that violates proportionality.

## Relation to Congruity Canonical

The canonical definition of the Law of Congruity is upstream.

This repository is an interpretation layer.

## Repository map

`START_HERE.md`  
Minimal entry point and reading order

`CLAIMS.md`  
What is claimed, what is not claimed, what would count as evidence

`BOUNDARY_TESTS.md`  
Admissibility checks, what would make an α claim non admissible

`NOTES.md`  
Working notes and references

## Status

Early scaffold, statements are conceptual and conservative.

Evolution happens by tightening constraints, not by adding speculation.
