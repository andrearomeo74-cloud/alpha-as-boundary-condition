# Boundary Tests

This file defines simple admissibility checks for narratives involving the fine structure constant α.

These are not experiments.
They are boundary tests.
A narrative passes only if it remains coherent under proportional cost accounting.

Notation used informally

E means required energy and physical work
I means required information, control, measurement precision, feedback
S means required structure, infrastructure, apparatus scale, stabilization overhead
V means claimed functional value

A claim is admissible only if the implied E, I, and S do not silently diverge relative to V.

## Test 1, Free knob test

If a narrative treats α like a dial that can be turned at will, it fails unless it explains:

• what physical degree of freedom is being actuated  
• what prevents back reaction and instability  
• what the proportional E, I, and S costs are  

Fail condition

If α is described as directly controllable without a concrete cost model, the claim is non admissible.

## Test 2, Cheap control test

If the narrative implies “small input, huge outcome” it must show why this is not a proportionality violation.

Pass requires

• an explicit accounting showing where costs are paid  
• a mechanism that does not hide costs in unmodeled structure  
• an explanation of why the effect does not scale into runaway instability  

Fail condition

If the narrative relies on “just the right vibration” without cost scaling, it is non admissible.

## Test 3, Renormalization consistency test

If α is claimed to change, the narrative must distinguish:

• effective coupling at a scale, running with energy  
• the low energy measured α used in everyday physics  

Pass requires

• clarity about which regime is meant  
• consistency with standard RG interpretation  
• no implication that running equals engineering control  

Fail condition

If “running of α” is presented as a method to engineer constants, it is non admissible.

## Test 4, Measurement and observability test

Any claim about changing α must explain:

• how α is operationally inferred  
• what measurement precision is required  
• how systematic errors, calibration, and stability are handled  

Pass requires

• explicit observables, not metaphors  
• a stated uncertainty boundary  
• a stable measurement chain  

Fail condition

If the narrative cannot specify observables and measurement constraints, it is non admissible.

## Test 5, Causality and locality test

If the claim implies spacetime shortcuts, warp, teleport, or reactionless thrust, it must show:

• how locality and conservation are respected  
• where momentum exchange occurs  
• how causal structure remains coherent  

Pass requires

• a conservation consistent accounting  
• a clear interaction channel  
• no hand waving around momentum, reaction mass, or fields  

Fail condition

If propulsion is asserted without an admissible momentum and energy ledger, it is non admissible.

## Test 6, Hidden structure test

Many claims hide costs in unspecified infrastructure.

Pass requires

• explicit description of required apparatus class  
• stabilization requirements, shielding, field strengths, coherence time  
• how scaling behaves as the effect is increased  

Fail condition

If the story works only by leaving structure implicit, it is non admissible.

## Test 7, Semantic metaphor separation test

Metaphors are allowed, but they must be labeled as metaphors.

Pass requires

• a clear separation between analogy and physics  
• constraints stated in physical terms when making physical claims  

Fail condition

If metaphor is presented as mechanism, it is non admissible.

## Test 8, Invariance under cost accounting

A narrative should remain coherent when all costs are made explicit.

Pass requires

• no step that becomes impossible once costs are included  
• no unbounded amplification without compensatory overhead  

Fail condition

If the claim collapses under explicit E, I, S accounting, it is non admissible.

## Output labels

Use these labels when evaluating a narrative

• ADMISSIBLE, coherent with constraints, costs accounted  
• NON ADMISSIBLE, violates proportionality or hides costs  
• UNDECIDED, requires sharper definitions or regime clarity
