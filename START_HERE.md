# Start Here

This repository is a conceptual study of the fine structure constant α within the Congruity framework.

It is not a proposal to modify physics.
It is not a claim of control.
It is not a speculative theory.

It is an admissibility analysis.

## How to read this repository

Read in this order:

1. START_HERE.md  
2. README.md  
3. CLAIMS.md  
4. BOUNDARY_TESTS.md  
5. NOTES.md  

Each file tightens constraints instead of expanding narratives.

## What problem this repository addresses

Many public narratives treat α as if it were:

• A tunable parameter  
• A resonance target  
• A vibration-controlled knob  
• A shortcut to propulsion or spacetime manipulation  

These narratives usually skip proportional cost accounting.

This repository asks a simpler question:

Under what conditions would a claim about α remain admissible?

## The Congruity lens applied

Within Congruity, any claim must respect proportionality between:

• Energy  
• Information  
• Structure  
• Functional Value  

If a claim about α implies:

• Low energy cost  
• Low informational control  
• Minimal structural overhead  

while asserting high functional leverage, it is flagged as non admissible.

## Boundary framing

α is treated here as a boundary condition, not as an internal degree of freedom.

Boundary conditions are not optimized.
They are respected.

Attempts to “exploit” boundary conditions without paying global costs typically violate coherence.

## What success looks like in this repo

Success is not prediction.
Success is constraint clarity.

A successful outcome is the ability to say:

• This type of α claim is admissible  
• This type is not  
• This is where the boundary lies  

No more, no less.

## What happens next

This repository does not conclude with answers.

It concludes with filters.

Anything that survives those filters may be studied elsewhere, downstream, with appropriate mathematical and experimental rigor.
